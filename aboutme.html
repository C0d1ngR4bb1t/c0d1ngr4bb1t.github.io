    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/About-Me-blue?style=plastic">
    <p>I like to codeüë©‚Äçüíª in my free time, but I also love Ethical Hacking. <br>I wish I had more free time to learn more!<br><br>When I code (even I don't dispose of so much free time, I code anyways), I usually use Python3, HTML5, and JavaScript. But, please, don't think that I know how to code very well, because my knowledge corresponds to a starter. This is due to the my lack of free time.</p>
    <p>I have a dog: A Shiba Inu (it's so cute)</p>
    <p>Please, sorry for my <i>(sometimes)</i> bad english</p>
